This is a simple 3D vector class. It supports all operations (+,-,*,/),
normalization, cross and dot product, random vector generation (and on a unit sphere).
There is a Makefile provided. I also added some unit tests using CATCH. You can run 
them with 'cd test' and 'g++ -o main main.cpp ../src/vec3.cpp'.
I also added documentation wich is generated by 'doxygen doxconfig'.
